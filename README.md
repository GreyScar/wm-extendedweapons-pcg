READ ME:
Hm, so this is my first time doing the moddy thing haha this is really just a pet project, nothing too serious! But I do love this kinds so I might as well! So I guess I should start with talking about the aim of this mod and what it intends to add/modify. Actually, well, its more like two mods in one.

* Extended Weaponry
I just wanted to add some more diversity in terms of weapons you can find, modify and create in the end-world. Some of which will be proper weapons that you can find, while other's seem like insane machinations of society trying to survive in a cataclysmic event!

* PCE - Proprietary Cybernetic Equipment
Do you like cyborgs? I like Cyborgs. Do you like stuff such as interfaceable gear that can be partially mechanized or tailored to a cyborgs' needs and everyday challenges? (Or new challenges considering the nastiness that is the Cataclysm,) welp. That's what I'm working on, a lot of these cybernetic tools, gadgets, weapons, and more will feel like extensions of the cyborgs' body and what they can offer.(If they got the right 'mods.' some gear may be out of use for cyborgs lacking certain modifications,) Some of this gear will feel tailored to the industry and maybe some military as they are pre-cataclysm inventions designed to aid cybernetic individuals. On the other hand, some will be terrifying machinations in the Post-Cataclysm era, cybernetic extensions jurry-rigged with the intent for survival!

REVISIONS
Considering raising the power to 250 per turn, making its maximim usage with a medium plutonim battery 25 turns, since it is rather powerful.
Need to remove UPS for these as they are powered by Cybernetics (haha) Also need to make them active power armor as well, so they add the buffs they should add. Needs a Light, Heavy and Medium Variant, all tailored to different gear, Alu-u's aren't designed for combat, but iunno if that's stop someone from trying?

CONSIDERATIONS
Rod said I should make a training-manual for each power frame, not reading these will bar you from using techniques with them. Still need to figure out how to do that, but I like that layer added growth that PC has to learn to wield them. 

I'm also thinking of, as an inside joke and since this game won't stop trolling me with vibrators, you will need two vibrators in order to make the phasing chokuto, but I'mma wait on that. "I mean you're getting the oscillator parts from somewhere right?" [okay, nvmed on this but damn it game, stop trolling me with these!]
