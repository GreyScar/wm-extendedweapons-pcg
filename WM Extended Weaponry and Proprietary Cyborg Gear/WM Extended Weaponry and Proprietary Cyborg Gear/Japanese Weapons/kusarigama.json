    "description": "This is a full replica of the kusarigama, a sickle welded to a 3m chain, with a weighted-lure attached to the other end. The key is to twirl the weight above the wielder’s head to create a ‘danger-zone,’ and generate momentum. Strikes come wicked fast and at a great range--with some to cost to mobility. It requires incredible skill from its user, and gets caught by high-grass and other foliage, but it’s not a weapon to take lightly. This particular model boast incredible craftsmenship, and is ready for combat.",
