    "//": "A form of PCE (proprietary cybernetic equipment), engineered by some of the more insane craftsmen of the Old Guard, rigged specifically for the famous (or infamous) Snow-meow, these powered gauntlets attatch to the arms of any alloy-plated cyborg. When un-activated, they make a great shield but are heavy and unwieldy. Activate to power the unit and transform the weapon into its energy-powered bladed-form. Of course, these take immense strength to wield. A Personal UPS is recommended for operating this machinery.",
