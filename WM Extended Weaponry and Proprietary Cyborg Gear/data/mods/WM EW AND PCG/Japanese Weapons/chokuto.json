    "description": "A re-creation of an ancient Japanese straight-sword; often considered the predecessor to the tachi and later the uchigatana and katana; this is a straight-edged broadsword with a design similar to the jian and the piandao, but with a traditional Japanese-edge and handle; its lightweight, extended handle, and subtly-long length make it an excellent dueling weapon for sword-dancers and more dexterous sword-fighters. It can be wielded with one or two hands. /“Please, don’t call it a ninja-sword.” This particular replica shows impressive craftsmanship and is ready for combat./",
