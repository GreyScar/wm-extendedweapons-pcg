    "//": "A form of post-cataclysm PCE (proprietary cybernetic equipment), engineered by some of the more insane craftsmen of the Old Guard, rigged specifically for the famous (or infamous) Snow-meow, these powered gauntlets attatch to the arms of any alloy-plated cyborg. When un-activated, they make a great shield but are heavy and unwieldy. Activate to add support of the armored frame. Of course, these take immense strength to wield and the power-gauntlet's are designed to assist with this. (Reading the unit manual is advised.) A Personal UPS is recommended for operating this unit.",
